# UNSW Memes data
For UNSW Memes, within the backend, data can be read and updated with the two functions `getData()` and `setData()`. The data is **persistent** as it is stored in a file called `database.json` and has constraints as according to the 5 interfaces  `User`, `Channel`, `Dm`, `Message` and `Data`.

The 6 interfaces are shown below.

```typescript
interface User {
  uId: number;
  nameFirst: string;
  nameLast: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  handleStr: string;
  permission: number;
  tokens: string[];
  resetCode: string;
  profileImgUrl: string;
}

interface React {
  reactId: number;
  uIds: number[];
  isThisUserReacted: boolean;
}

interface Message {
  messageId: number;
  uId: number;
  message: string;
  timeSent: number;
  reacts: React[],
  isPinned: boolean;
}

interface Channel {
  channelId: number;
  channelName: string;
  ownerMembersIds: number[];
  allMembersIds: number[];
  isPublic: boolean;
  standupIsActive: boolean;
  standupTimeFinish: number;
  currStandUpQueue: string[];
  messages: Message[];
}

interface Dm {
  dmId: number;
  dmName: string;
  creatorId: number;
  memberIds: number[],
  messages: Message[];
}

interface Data {
  users: User[];
  channels: Channel[];
  dms: Dm[];
}
```

The `database.json` file will initially be unpopulated as shown below.
```json
{"users":[],"channels":[],"dms":[]}
```

An example of a populated data store is shown below.

[Optional] short description: 

## Using the data
To use the `getData` and `setData` functions, an import statement is required from the `dataStore.ts` file. Additionally, when updating the data, interfaces can be used to ensure objects added are of the corresponding type. As example of how to import the functions and interfaces is shown below.
```typescript
import { User, Channel, Dm, Message, Data, getData, setData } from './dataStore';
```

The aforementioned two functions `getData` and `setData` are used as follows

#### getData()
The `getData()` function reads the data from the database file at `dataBasePath` (which in our case is `./src/database.json`) and returns the parsed JSON data.

#### SetData(newData: Data)

The `setData(newData: Data)` function writes the passed-in `newData` to the database file at `dataBasePath`. This function overwrites the entire data object.

## How clients will manipulate the data
Clients will manipulate the data through the various POST, PUT, GET and DELETE routes as specified in the `server.ts` file which uses the [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework to wrap around to the TypeScript functions which use `getData` and `setData`.

## How the data is organised
The data has 3 keys being `users`, `channels` and `dms` which have arrays of objects as according to their corresponding interface as shown above.

The `channels` and `dms` keys will both have keys called `messages` where by the corresponding `Message` interface is used.

## In the User interface, the permission can have 3 possible values
- 1 ( user is global owner)
- 2 (user is a normal member)
- 420 (user is banned)
